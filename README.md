DEPRECATED
==========

This repo is no longer supported.  The `firebase-admin` package on npm is now published by Google as of v4; the code here has nothing to do with `firebase-admin@4` and no longer works.

firebase-admin
==============

Programmatically instantiate and modify [Firebase](https://firebase.com) instances.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/casetext/firebase-admin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/casetext/firebase-admin)

## Why?

For automated testing, mostly.

## Install

```npm install --save firebase-admin```

## Use

```javascript
var FirebaseAccount = require('firebase-admin');
var Firebase = require('firebase');

var account = new FirebaseAccount(process.env.FIREBASE_ADMIN_TOKEN);
account.createDatabase('new-instance-name')
.then(function(instance) {
  var fb = new Firebase(instance.toString());
})
.catch(function(err) {
  console.error('Oops, error creating instance:', err);
});
```

## Documentation

There's JSDoc-generated [API documentation](https://casetext.github.io/firebase-admin).

## Develop

```bash
git clone https://github.com/casetext/firebase-admin
cd firebase-admin
npm install
npm test
```

Please ```jshint```. That is all.

## Caveats

- This package uses Firebase's own APIs. You can't do anything with it you can't
already do in the admin tools and Forge.
- Do not abuse the Firebase service. It's amazing and the people who work there
are amazing.

Big whoop, wanna fight about it?
